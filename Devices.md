# Speedgram Login Display Devices

## What are they, and why do they appear that way?

Speedgram operates by using device simulation through the browser.  While all requests are being made by you directly on your computer, we simulate that you are making the requests from a mobile device, usually a Samsung device such as a Galaxy S7 (herolte) or another miscelaneous Samsung device.  If you see that a device you don't own or use is being used to login to Instagram, don't be alarmed, and instead confirm that **__the location to login to the device is the same or similar location to where you currently are__**.  Since there is no need to simulate a different location, your display location for the login message should match that of your IP address, which you can check at https://whatismyip.com
